6. There will be a feature to find out what the user wants the app to do (as there might be multiple modes).

potential glossary vocab:

- syllable:
- rhyme scheme:
- pronouncing dictionary:

todo:

- create copy of this doc and make things more general and abstract (these are for communication between dev and users so there needs to be a common understanding)
- eliminate 'how' such as .net library
- research if there's:
  - another market for this
  - how youtubers color code their stuff in real time (can i make an extension for this?)
  - NLP ways of doing this such as OpenAI or Llama (local)
